This project analyzes neural activity in mice during a decision-making task, focusing on how task conditions and brain area-specific activity influence performance. Using logistic regression and random forest models with PCA features, I predict trial outcomes, finding that neural activity is stronger during successful trials and varies significantly across brain areas and contrast conditions. My findings show the importance of the session/mouse and time specific data in predicting how a decision will be made.

  <summary style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold;">Section 1: Introduction</summary>

In this project, I analyze a subset of data collected by Steinmetz et al. (2019) to understand the neural mechanisms underlying decision-making in mice. The study involved presenting visual stimuli to mice and recording neural activity in the visual cortex during decision-making tasks. My primary objective is to explore how neural activity varies with different task conditions, such as contrast levels and feedback types, and to identify patterns that correlate with successful task performance. I will then apply this knowledge to the preparation of the data for integration, enabling better predictive performance. Finally, I will build a prediction model to predict the outcome, and then test it on given test data.

  <summary style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Data Description</summary>

The dataset includes recordings from 18 sessions across four mice, with each session comprising several hundred trials. For each trial, we have information on the contrast levels of the visual stimuli, the feedback type (success or failure), and the spike trains of neurons in the visual cortex. I focus on the spike trains from the onset of the stimuli to 0.4 seconds post-onset.

</details>

<details>
  <summary style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold;">Data Structure</summary>

A total of 18 RDS files are provided that contain the records from 18 sessions. In each RDS file, you can find the name of mouse from `mouse_name` and date of the experiment from `date_exp`. 


```{r echo = F}
session=list()
for(i in 1:18){
  session[[i]]=readRDS(paste('./Data/session',i,'.rds',sep=''))
}
```

Five variables are available for each trial, namely 

- `feedback_type`: type of the feedback, 1 for success and -1 for failure
- `contrast_left`: contrast of the left stimulus
- `contrast_right`: contrast of the right stimulus
- `time`: centers of the time bins for `spks`  
- `spks`: numbers of spikes of neurons in the visual cortex in time bins defined in `time`
- `brain_area`: area of the brain where each neuron lives

Take the 11th trial in Session 5 for example, we can see that the left contrast for this trial is 
```{r echo = F}
session[[5]]$contrast_left[11]
```  
the right contrast is 
```{r echo = F} 
session[[5]]$contrast_right[11]
```
the feedback (i.e., outcome) of the trial is 
```{r echo = F} 
session[[5]]$feedback_type[11]
```
There are a total of 
```{r echo = F} 
length(session[[5]]$brain_area)
``` 
neurons in this trial from 
```{r echo = F} 
length(unique(session[[5]]$brain_area))
``` 
areas of the brain. The spike trains of these neurons are stored in 
```{r echo = F}
head(session[[5]]$spks[[11]])
``` 
which is a 
```{r echo = F}
dim(session[[5]]$spks[[11]])[1]
``` 
by 
```{r echo = F}
dim(session[[5]]$spks[[11]])[2]
``` 
matrix with each entry being the number of spikes of one neuron (i.e., row) in each time bin (i.e., column).

  <summary style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Summarize Session Information</summary>
  
We can report mouse_name, date_exp, number of brain_area, number of neurons, number of trials, and success rate for each session.

```{r echo = F}
# Create a tibble to store session metadata
n.session <- length(session)
meta <- tibble(
  mouse_name = rep('name', n.session),
  date_exp = rep('dt', n.session),
  n_brain_area = rep(0, n.session),
  n_neurons = rep(0, n.session),
  n_trials = rep(0, n.session),
  success_rate = rep(0, n.session)
)

# Fill the metadata tibble
for (i in 1:n.session) {
  tmp <- session[[i]]
  meta[i, 1] <- tmp$mouse_name
  meta[i, 2] <- tmp$date_exp
  meta[i, 3] <- length(unique(tmp$brain_area))
  meta[i, 4] <- dim(tmp$spks[[1]])[1]
  meta[i, 5] <- length(tmp$feedback_type)
  meta[i, 6] <- mean(tmp$feedback_type + 1) / 2
}

# Print the metadata table
kable(meta, format = "html", table.attr = "class='table table-striped'", digits = 2)
```
  
Notably, we can see that Lederberg has the most sessions and appears to have the highest overall success_rate.

<details>
  <summary style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Compare Success Rates Between Mice</summary>

We can compare the average success rates across mice.

```{r echo = F}
# Summarize success rates by mouse
mouse_summary <- meta %>%
  group_by(mouse_name) %>%
  summarize(avg_success_rate = mean(success_rate))

# Plot success rates by mouse
ggplot(mouse_summary, aes(x = mouse_name, y = avg_success_rate, fill = mouse_name)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +

       x = "Mouse",

  theme_minimal()
```

<details>
  <summary style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Session-Level Analysis</summary>
  
We can analyze neural activity at the session level.

```{r echo = F}
# Function to calculate average spike counts per brain area for a given trial
average_spike_area <- function(i.t, this_session) {
  spk.trial = this_session$spks[[i.t]]  # Extract spike data for the trial
  area = this_session$brain_area  # Extract brain area labels
  spk.count = apply(spk.trial, 1, sum)  # Calculate total spikes per neuron
  spk.average.tapply = tapply(spk.count, area, mean)  # Average spikes per brain area
  return(spk.average.tapply)
}

# Analyze Session 5 (chosen at random)
i.s <- 5
n.trial <- length(session[[i.s]]$feedback_type)
n.area <- length(unique(session[[i.s]]$brain_area))

# Create trial.summary for Session 5
trial.summary <- matrix(nrow = n.trial, ncol = n.area + 4)
for (i.t in 1:n.trial) {
  avg_spikes <- average_spike_area(i.t, this_session = session[[i.s]])
  trial.summary[i.t, ] <- c(
    avg_spikes,
    session[[i.s]]$feedback_type[i.t],
    session[[i.s]]$contrast_left[i.t],
    session[[i.s]]$contrast_right[i.t],
    i.t
  )
}

# Add column names
colnames(trial.summary) <- c(
  names(avg_spikes),  # Names of brain areas
  "feedback", "left_contr", "right_contr", "id"
)

# Convert to a tibble
trial.summary <- as_tibble(trial.summary)

# Plot average spike counts across trials
trial.summary.long <- trial.summary %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -c(feedback, left_contr, right_contr, id),
               names_to = "area",
               values_to = "average_spikes")

ggplot(trial.summary.long, aes(x = id, y = average_spikes, color = area)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Average Spike Counts Across Trials for Session 5",
       x = "Trial ID",
       y = "Average Spike Counts",
       color = "Brain Area") +
  theme_minimal()
```
  
  
**Interpretation**: The plot shows average spike counts across trials during Session 5 for each brain area. Certain areas (e.g., root) exhibit higher activity compared to others. The fluctuations across trials suggest that feedback type has an effect on the spike counts of the mice.

<details>
  <summary style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Trial-Level Analysis</summary>

We can visualize neural activity at the trial level.

```{r echo = F}
# Function to plot neural activity for a single trial
plot.trial <- function(i.t, area, area.col, this_session) {
  spks <- this_session$spks[[i.t]]
  n.neuron <- dim(spks)[1]
  time.points <- this_session$time[[i.t]]
  
  plot(0, 0, xlim = c(min(time.points), max(time.points)), ylim = c(0, n.neuron + 1), 
       col = 'white', xlab = 'Time (s)', yaxt = 'n', ylab = 'Neuron', 
       main = paste('Trial ', i.t, 'feedback', this_session$feedback_type[i.t]), cex.lab = 1.5)
  
  for (i in 1:n.neuron) {
    i.a <- which(area == this_session$brain_area[i])
    col.this <- area.col[i.a]
    
    ids.spike <- which(spks[i, ] > 0)  # Find spike timestamps
    if (length(ids.spike) > 0) {
      points(x = time.points[ids.spike], y = rep(i, length(ids.spike)), 
             pch = '.', cex = 2, col = col.this)
    }
  }
  
  legend("topright", legend = area, col = area.col, pch = 16, cex = 0.8)
}

# Plot neural activity for Trial 1 and Trial 2 in Session 2
area.col <- rainbow(n = n.area, alpha = 0.7)
varname <- names(trial.summary)
area <- varname[1:(length(varname) - 4)]
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot.trial(1, area, area.col, session[[i.s]])
plot.trial(2, area, area.col, session[[i.s]])
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
```
  
**Interpretation**: The plot shows neural activity for individual trials. Each dot represents a spike, and colors correspond to different brain areas. Patterns of activity vary depending on feedback type. This suggests that there is a specific time where average spike count is highest due to the effects of feedback.

<details>
  <summary style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Success Rates by Contrast Conditions</summary>

We can analyze how success rates vary with different contrast conditions.

```{r echo = F}
# Function to calculate and plot success rates by contrast conditions
analyze_success_rates <- function(i.s, session) {
  session_data <- session[[i.s]]
  
  # Calculate success rates for different contrast conditions
  success_rates <- tibble(
    contrast_left = session_data$contrast_left,
    contrast_right = session_data$contrast_right,
    feedback_type = session_data$feedback_type
  ) %>%
    group_by(contrast_left, contrast_right) %>%
    summarize(success_rate = mean(feedback_type == 1), .groups = 'drop')
  
  # Plot success rates
  plot <- ggplot(success_rates, aes(x = factor(contrast_left), y = factor(contrast_right), fill = success_rate)) +
    geom_tile() +
    scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "blue") +
    labs(title = paste("Success Rates by Contrast Conditions for Session", i.s),
         x = "Left Contrast",
         y = "Right Contrast",
         fill = "Success Rate") +
    theme_minimal()
  
  return(plot)
}
```

```{r echo = F}
# Aggregate success rates across all sessions
all_success_rates <- do.call(rbind, lapply(1:18, function(i.s) {
  session_data <- session[[i.s]]
  tibble(
    contrast_left = session_data$contrast_left,
    contrast_right = session_data$contrast_right,
    feedback_type = session_data$feedback_type,
    session = i.s
  )
}))

# Calculate success rates for each contrast condition
success_rate_summary <- all_success_rates %>%
  group_by(contrast_left, contrast_right) %>%
  summarize(
    success_rate = mean(feedback_type == 1),  # Calculate success rate
    .groups = 'drop'
  )

# Plot aggregated success rates
ggplot(success_rate_summary, aes(x = factor(contrast_left), y = factor(contrast_right), fill = success_rate)) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "blue") +
  labs(
    title = "Aggregated Success Rates by Contrast Conditions",
    x = "Left Contrast",
    y = "Right Contrast",
    fill = "Success Rate"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
  
**Interpretation**: The heatmap shows success rates for different combinations of left and right contrasts. High success rates (darker colors) indicate conditions where the mouse reliably made correct decisions. For example, when `contrast_left = 1` and `contrast_right = 0`, the mouse should turn the wheel to the left. A high success rate here suggests the mouse correctly followed the rule. Conversely, when contrasts are equal (e.g., `0.5 vs. 0.5`), success rates are lower, as the correct choice is random.") This heatmap is the aggregate of every session.

    x = "Session",
    y = "Average Spike Counts",
    color = "Mouse"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
  
**Interpretation**: An upward trend across sessions, such as with Cori and Forssmann, may indicate mice are learning the task and becoming more engaged, or that the neurons are adapting to the stimuli over time. A downward trend across sessions, such as with Hench and Lederberg, may indicate that the mice are becoming fatigued or disengaged, or that the neurons are habituating to the stimuli. As we see that Lederberg's success rate increases with session, in his case this suggests the latter.

    mean(rowSums(session_data$spks[[i.t]]))  # Mean spikes per neuron for failure trials
  })
  
  # Handle cases where there are no success or failure trials
  success_avg <- if (length(success_spikes) > 0) mean(success_spikes) else NA
  failure_avg <- if (length(failure_spikes) > 0) mean(failure_spikes) else NA
  
  # Create a tibble for the session
  tibble(

  )
}))

# Plot success vs. failure spike counts

    x = "Session",
    y = "Average Spike Counts",
    color = "Feedback Type"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
  
**Interpretation**: As the success line is consistently higher than the failure line, the neural activity appears to be stronger during successful trials. Increases in the success line could indicate that the mouse is learning the task, leading to stronger neural activity during successful trials. Decreases in the failure line could indicate that the mouse is making fewer mistakes, leading to weaker neural activity during failed trials. We can assume then that the model will likely have a bias towards successes in predicting the outcome of trials.

```{r echo = F}
# Compare feedback effects by brain area
feedback_by_area <- trial.summary.long %>%
  group_by(area, feedback) %>%
  summarize(avg_spikes = mean(average_spikes), .groups = 'drop')

ggplot(feedback_by_area, aes(x = area, y = avg_spikes, fill = factor(feedback))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Average Spike Counts by Brain Area and Feedback Type",
       x = "Brain Area",
       y = "Average Spike Counts",
       fill = "Feedback Type") +
  theme_minimal()
```
  
**Interpretation**: The feedback appears to effect some brain areas, such as root or SUB, more than others, like ACA and ORB, which appear to have about equal average spike counts depending on feedback type. Because of this, a focus on filtering to certain brain areas may not be the best way to predict the outcome of trials.

```{r echo = F}
# Function to find the time bin with the most active neurons in a trial
find_most_active_time_bin <- function(spks, time_points) {
  # Calculate total spikes per time bin across all neurons
  total_spikes_per_bin <- colSums(spks)
  
  # Find the time bin with the maximum total spikes
  max_spike_bin <- which.max(total_spikes_per_bin)
  
  # Return the corresponding time point
  return(time_points[max_spike_bin])
}

# Example: Find the most active time bin for Trial 1 in Session 5
most_active_time_bin <- find_most_active_time_bin(session[[5]]$spks[[1]], session[[5]]$time[[1]])
print(most_active_time_bin)
```

**Interpretation**: Each mouse has periods of time during their trials in which the amount of active neurons is at its highest. For session 5, trial 1, it is at time = 57.5774 seconds.

  <summary style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Key Insights</summary>

#### **1. Neural Activity and Task Performance**
- **Higher Neural Activity During Success:**
  - Neural activity (spike counts) is consistently higher during **successful trials** compared to failed trials.
  - This suggests that **successful task performance** is associated with stronger neural engagement or more synchronized neural firing.

- **Learning Effects:**
  - A **downward trend in neural activity** for some mice (e.g., Lederberg) across sessions may indicate that the mice may be **learning the task** and becoming more engaged over time.
  - Conversely, for other mice (e.g., Hench and Cori) may suggest **fatigue** or **habituation** to the task.

---

#### **2. Brain Area-Specific Activity**
- **Variability in Brain Area Activity:**
  - Certain brain areas (e.g., "root") exhibit **higher neural activity** compared to others.
  - This suggests that **specific brain areas** may play a more significant role in processing the visual stimuli or making decisions.

- **Feedback-Dependent Activity:**
  - Neural activity patterns vary depending on **feedback type** (success or failure).
  - For example, certain brain areas may show **increased activity** during successful trials, while others may show **decreased activity** during failed trials.

---

#### **3. Contrast Conditions and Decision-Making**
- **Clear Contrast Differences Drive Success:**
  - Mice perform best when there is a **clear difference** between the left and right contrasts (e.g., `1 vs. 0`).
  - This suggests that mice rely on **contrast differences** to make decisions, and their performance improves when the task is easier (i.e., the correct choice is more obvious).

- **Random Guessing in Equal Contrasts:**
  - When the left and right contrasts are **equal** (e.g., `0.5 vs. 0.5`), success rates drop to around **50%**, indicating that mice are **guessing** rather than making informed decisions.
  - This aligns with the experimental design, where the correct choice is **random** in equal contrast conditions.

---

#### **4. Individual Differences Between Mice**
- **Variability in Success Rates:**
  - Some mice have **higher success rates** compared to others.
  - This suggests **individual differences** in learning ability, decision-making, or engagement with the task.
  - This may mean that focusing on some mice over others may be a better way to improving the predictive model.

- **Variability in Neural Activity Trends:**
  - Neural activity trends vary between mice, with some showing an **upward trend** and others showing a **downward trend**.
  - These differences may reflect **variability in how mice adapt** to the task over time.

---

#### **5. Feedback Effects on Neural Activity**
- **Feedback as a Modulator of Neural Activity:**
  - **Successful trials** are associated with **higher spike counts**, suggesting that positive feedback may **enhance neural engagement**.
  - **Failed trials** are associated with **lower spike counts**, suggesting that negative feedback may **reduce neural activity** or lead to disengagement.

---

#### **6. Temporal Dynamics of Neural Activity**
- **Trial-Level Variability:**
  - Neural activity varies significantly across trials, even within the same session.
  - This variability may reflect **changes in attention**, **task difficulty**, or **feedback effects** on a trial-by-trial basis.

- **Time-Dependent Patterns:**
  - Neural activity is **temporally organized**, with spikes occurring at specific time points during the trial.
  - This suggests that neural activity reflects **processing of visual stimuli** or **decision-making processes**.

- **Average spike counts per brain area**: This feature captures the overall neural engagement in different brain regions, which is crucial for understanding how different areas contribute to decision-making.

- **Temporal patterns of spike counts**: By focusing on specific time bins (e.g., 0–0.2 seconds and 0.2–0.4 seconds post-stimulus onset), I can capture the dynamic nature of neural responses to stimuli.

- **Feedback-dependent spike counts**: Since neural activity differs significantly between successful and failed trials, separating these features allows the model to learn from feedback-specific patterns, which could improve predictive performance.

- **Key Insight**: Neural activity is not uniform across brain areas or time. By extracting these features, I can capture the heterogeneity in neural responses, which is essential for building a robust predictive model.

- **Proportion of active neurons**: This feature captures the percentage of neurons that fired at least one spike during the trial. A higher proportion indicates greater neural engagement.

- **Average firing rate**: This feature represents the average number of spikes per neuron per time bin. It provides insight into the overall level of neural activity during the trial.

- **Brain area-specific averages**: By calculating average spike counts for each brain area, I can identify which areas are most active during the task. This reveals areas that play a key role in decision-making.

```{r echo = F}
# Combined function to flatten, normalize, and reorganize spike counts
process_spike_counts <- function(session_data) {
  n_trials <- length(session_data$feedback_type)
  n_neurons <- dim(session_data$spks[[1]])[1]  # Number of neurons per trial
  
  # Step 1: Flatten spike counts into a tidy format
  spike_counts <- tibble(
    trial_id = rep(1:n_trials, each = n_neurons),
    neuron_id = rep(1:n_neurons, times = n_trials),
    spike_count = unlist(lapply(session_data$spks, rowSums))  # Sum spikes per neuron per trial
  )
  
  # Step 2: Normalize spike counts using z-score normalization
  spike_counts <- spike_counts %>%
    group_by(neuron_id) %>%  # Normalize by neuron to account for neuron-specific baselines
    mutate(normalized_spikes = scale(spike_count))  # Z-score normalization
  
  return(spike_counts)  # Return the normalized spike counts with neuron_id
}

# Example usage for Session 5
session_5_trial_level_spikes <- process_spike_counts(session[[5]])
head(session_5_trial_level_spikes)

# Merge normalized spike counts with other trial-level features
session_5_features = session_5_features %>%
  left_join(session_5_trial_level_spikes, by = "trial_id")
```
  
- Neural activity can vary significantly across sessions due to differences in baseline firing rates or recording conditions. Z-score normalization ensures that spike counts are on a comparable scale across sessions, allowing the model to focus on relative changes in activity rather than absolute values.

- **Key Insight**: Normalization is critical for integrating data across sessions, as it reduces session-specific biases and ensures that the model can generalize well to new data.

- Neural activity data is high-dimensional, with many neurons and time bins. PCA reduces the dimensionality of the data while preserving the most important patterns of variance. This not only simplifies the model but also helps mitigate the risk of overfitting.

- **Key Insight**: The first 5 principal components capture the majority of the variance in the neural activity data, allowing the model to focus on the most informative features for prediction.

- **Model Bias Toward Success**:
  - In sessions with low accuracy, the model tends to predict all trials as successes (1). This suggests that the model may be biased toward the majority class (successes), especially in sessions where failures are underrepresented.

  - For example, in Session 17, the model predicts only predicts a total of 10 trials to be failures
  
- **Variability Across Mice**:

  - The model performs well for Lederberg and moderately for Forssmann and Hench, but struggles with Cori. This could be due to differences in neural activity patterns, task engagement, or data quality across mice.
  
- **Impact of Contrast Conditions**:

  - The model's performance may be influenced by the distribution of contrast conditions in each session. For example, sessions with more balanced contrast conditions (e.g., equal left and right contrasts) may be harder to predict, leading to lower accuracy.
  
- **Neural Activity Patterns**:

  - The model relies on neural activity features (e.g., average spikes, firing rates) to make predictions. Sessions with more distinct neural activity patterns for successes and failures may yield higher accuracy.

- The dataset has significantly more successes than failures, which causes the model to prioritize predicting successes.

- Session specific model accuracy is about the same for the random forest model as it is for the logistic regression model

- The relative difference in how each session performs is the same between models
  - This means that in choosing a subset of sessions to build the model around, the choice of sessions would be the same for each model

```
  
- We filter the data to only include sessions twelve to eighteen because these are the ones that were performed by the mouse Lederberg
- Lederberg had the best overall performance from any mouse according to the accuracy of my model
  - Lederberg's average spike count went down each session, but his success rate overall went up with the progression of sessions
```{r echo = F}
# Combine data from sessions 12-18

- It looks like the logistic regression model with regards to Lederberg has a heavy bias towards successes, only predicting failures right about half the time.

- Because of an imbalance in the amount of failures and successes the model is biased towards predicting successes
  - The high precision and low recall reflects this, as it is good at predicting successes but struggles to predict failures
- The F1-Score balances precision and recall, and as such is a good metric of how balanced the model is.

  In this project, we analyzed neural activity in mice during a decision-making task, building predictive models to classify trial outcomes based on neural and task-related features. The final logistic regression model with PCA features achieved an accuracy of 73.04% on test data, with strong precision (86.46%) and recall (78.73%), though it struggled with failures due to dataset imbalance. A key insight was the importance of focusing on the time window when average spike counts were highest, which improved model performance by capturing critical neural engagement patterns. Lederberg, the best-performing mouse, showed improved success rates over time despite decreasing spike counts, highlighting the role of efficiency in learning. The logistic regression model was chosen for its interpretability and performance, demonstrating the potential of machine learning to predict behavioral outcomes from neural data. This work underscores the importance of integrating neural activity patterns, task conditions, and individual variability in understanding decision-making processes.
